# Idea 2: Stabilize E2E Test Suite

**Date:** 2025-04-30
**Status:** Proposed

## 1. Concept

Improve the reliability and stability of the automated Playwright E2E test suite (`tests/e2e/`). Currently, numerous tests are failing due to various reasons unrelated to recent code changes (like documentation additions).

## 2. Rationale & Problem

During the execution of Task T1.1.1 (adding JSDocs), running the E2E suite revealed significant failures including:
*   **Brittle Assertions:** Tests asserting exact AI response text fail due to the non-deterministic nature of AI models.
*   **Configuration Issues:** Tests requiring specific models (e.g., `chat-model-reasoning`) fail because the model isn't found in the test environment.
*   **Backend Errors:** The `/api/vote` endpoint appears broken, causing related tests to fail due to JSON parsing errors and database constraint violations.
*   **Timeouts/Flakiness:** Several tests time out, indicating potential performance bottlenecks or unstable test conditions.

Unreliable tests reduce confidence in the automated checks, slow down development (due to noise and debugging unrelated failures), and hinder the ability to quickly verify regressions. A stable test suite is essential for maintaining a workable project state and enabling faster development cycles.

## 3. Goal

*   Refactor brittle assertions (especially those checking exact AI text) to be more robust (e.g., check for keywords, structure, or successful completion rather than exact strings).
*   Fix test environment configuration issues (e.g., ensure required models like `chat-model-reasoning` are available or tests adapt).
*   Investigate and fix the underlying backend errors causing failures in `/api/vote`.
*   Analyze and address the causes of test timeouts.
*   Achieve a consistently "green" E2E test run on the main branch.

## 4. Potential Next Steps

*   Create a Design document detailing specific approaches for fixing brittle assertions, addressing config, and investigating backend/timeout issues.
*   Break down the stabilization effort into smaller, manageable Tasks.
