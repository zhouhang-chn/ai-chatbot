# Task T2.1.1: Fix E2E Test Suite Failures

**Author:** AI Assistant
**Date:** 2025-04-30
**Status:** To Do
**Effort Estimate:** TBD
**Risk Assessment:** Medium (Complexity of root causes unknown, potential for further cascading failures)

**Related Design:** [Design 2.1: Stabilize E2E Test Suite](../designs/2.1.Stabilize-E2E-Test-Suite.md)

## 1. Goal

To systematically address the failures identified in the E2E test suite (`npm test e2e`), aiming for a stable and faster test run suitable for CI/CD.

## 2. Background

Initial test runs revealed 22 failures out of 35 tests, primarily driven by component reference errors, timeouts, and configuration issues. Fixes for the component reference errors (`PureAttachmentsButton`, `PureSendButton`, `PureStopButton` in `multimodal-input.tsx`) have been applied but not yet verified by a full test run.

## 3. Subtasks

| Subtask ID | Description                                                                                                                               | Status   | Priority | Notes                                                                                                                                      |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| T2.1.1.1   | **Verify Button Reference Fixes:** Run `npm test e2e` and confirm the `ReferenceError` issues in `multimodal-input.tsx` are resolved.       | **To Do**  | High     | This should resolve many cascading timeout failures.                                                                                         |
| T2.1.1.2   | **Fix `chat-model-reasoning` Error:** Investigate test setup (`fixtures.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `.env`) and configure/fix the reasoning model. | **To Do**  | High     | Affects all tests in `reasoning.test.ts`.                                                                                                 |
| T2.1.1.3   | **Debug Timeout Failures (Basic UI):** Investigate remaining timeouts waiting for core UI elements (`multimodal-input`, buttons, etc.).      | **To Do**  | High     | Use Playwright traces. Likely indicates residual rendering issues if T2.1.1.1 didn't fix them.                                                |
| T2.1.1.4   | **Debug Timeout Failures (Specific Actions):** Investigate timeouts during specific actions (e.g., suggestions, `/api/chat` response).       | **To Do**  | Medium   | Use traces. Check component logic (suggestions) or backend logs (`/api/chat`).                                                             |
| T2.1.1.5   | **Debug Visibility Assertion Failures:** Investigate `toBeVisible` failures (e.g., `suggested-actions`, `Send a message...` placeholder, reasoning element). | **To Do**  | Medium   | Use traces. Check rendering logic/timing, backend data (for reasoning). Brittle assertions also tracked here (weather tool). |
| T2.1.1.6   | **Investigate `/api/vote` Failures:** If vote tests still fail, analyze backend logs. JSON/FK errors likely fixed by adding Content-Type header. | **In Progress** | Medium   | Fix applied (`message-actions.tsx`), needs verification via full test run.                                                  |
| T2.1.1.7   | **Optimize Test Speed:** Identify and implement optimizations during fixes (better selectors, waits, parallelization review).             | **To Do**  | Low      | Address as part of fixing individual tests. Aim to reduce the ~8min runtime.                                                               |
| T2.1.1.8   | **Update Design & Task Docs:** Refine estimates, risks, and task details as investigation progresses.                                       | **In Progress** | Low      | Updated based on latest run.                                                                                               |

## 4. Testing Strategy

1.  After completing T2.1.1.1, run `npm test e2e | cat`. Analyze results.
2.  After completing T2.1.1.2, run `npm test e2e | cat`. Analyze results, specifically `reasoning.test.ts`.
3.  For subsequent fixes (T2.1.1.3 - T2.1.1.6), run `npm test e2e | cat` or target specific test files (e.g., `npm test e2e chat.test.ts`) to verify the fix.
4.  Use Playwright trace files (`pnpm exec playwright show-trace test-results/.../trace.zip`) extensively for debugging UI-related failures.
5.  Monitor backend logs (especially for `/api/chat` and `/api/vote` issues).
6.  Once all subtasks are addressed, perform a final full run of `npm test e2e | cat` to confirm stability.
